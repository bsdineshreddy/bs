# Vegetation Analysis Using NDVI 🌱

This project analyzes vegetation health using multispectral satellite imagery.
NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) is computed from Red and NIR bands,
and the data is prepared for machine learning applications.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of multispectral satellite bands:
- B03 – Green
- B04 – Red
- B08 – Near Infrared (NIR)

## Features
- NDVI calculation
- False color composite generation
- ML-ready pixel-level dataset
